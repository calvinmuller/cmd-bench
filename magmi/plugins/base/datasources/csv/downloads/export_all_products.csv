","Sophisticated nails in a flash- no more drying time!","","","Of all the makeup looks out there, beautifully painted nails are my absolute favourite. If I had the time and the patience, my nails would be a different colour every week and I’d take nail art to the next level. However, as I’m always in a rush, I tend to smudge my nail polish almost every time. Plus having to wait for my base coat, two colour coats and a top coat to dry, means I try doing things with wet nails, only to ruin my mani.
 
I’d heard of nail strips before, but I never tried them because I didn’t believe a “sticker” would last any longer than normal nail polish, plus it seemed tricky to cut them into shape. Incoco Nail Polish Appliqué Strips proved me wrong, and since trying them out, I will never look at nail art in the same way- I was totally blown away! The strips are made from 100% real nail polish, and contain a base coat, colour coat and top coat. Free of formaldehyde and toluene, they won’t damage your nails either, so you can chop and change without worrying about harmful ingredients. They’re available in over 100 colours and styles, and for my first time, I chose a hot pink. One of the things I loved most about the product is that the strips come in a variety of different sizes, so you can match them to fit your nail shape perfectly. They’re flexible and stretch easily, so you can gently pull at them to make them fit over your whole nail. Once you’ve selected the right size, you gently peel the strip off its backing paper, place on your nail, stretch horizontally and across (if needed), fold the excess strip over the edge of your nail, and file it off. If you make a mistake you can gently peel the strip off and re-apply (provided you haven’t smoothed it out and filed the edge off). No mess, no smudges, no unpleasant smell and best of all, no waiting for liquid polish to dry. When they start to wear off or you get tired of the colour, you just lightly wipe over them with some regular nail polish remover on a piece of cotton wool. This was the fastest I’ve ever done my nails and the strips were super easy to apply too. It looked like I was wearing normal nail polish, except it had a very glossy shine to it that you don’t often find in liquid nail colours. The colour lasted a full week before it began to chip (to me this is extremely long, considering I’m always using my hands and normal polish lasts about three days). I got loads of compliments and was even asked if I’d had my nails done professionally. I’ll definitely be trying these strips again, and I think I’ll pick a colourful print next time.

Click here Size: 50ml","Say goodbye to rough skin with this all-natural cocoa exfoliator!","150","","Who’s a fan of a good scrub? When it comes to my weekly exfoliation, I usually prefer an enzymatic exfoliator to a physical scrub. The difference? Scrubs manually exfoliate the skin using small beads or particles such as sugar or apricot kernels, together with friction. Enzymatic exfoliators use active ingredients often derived from papaya or pineapple to chemically loosen the bond of dead skin cells. They’re ideal for sensitive, reactive or acne-prone skins as they dissolve the dead skin cells without the need for abrasive scrubbing.
 
After this week’s exfoliation with Esse Cocoa Exfoliator, I may have to change my tune about physical scrubs…not only did I love the delish choc scent thanks to the polishing cocoa particles, I was amazed at how easily it spread over my face and neck and there’s enough for next week too! I massaged the chocolate-y scrub gently over my face, paying particular attention to my T-zone and the corners of my nose. Before rinsing, as I had a bit left over on my hands, so I treated them to a quick scrub too – waste not, want not.
 
After rinsing, my skin felt luxuriously soft and plumped (not that stripped-clean feeling that can often happen). I followed with my night cream and whether it was the scrub alone or the combined effects of a restful weekend and the scrub, all I know is I’m making space for Esse Cocoa Exfoliator on my bathroom shelf! How about you?

","Take some time out and indulge with this luxurious soy body treat.","","","There’s nothing better than a warm and relaxing bath after a long day. Not only does it provide much needed me-time, but it also gives my body some time to unwind. I’m a big believer in aromatherapy and using fragrant products to help my body relax, so whenever I come across a new product like this, I’m eager to try it out. I’m new to the idea of soy candles, so when I received my Earl Jones Soy Candle in Iced Pear I couldn’t wait to take it home! At the end of a particularly busy day last week I lit my candle and relaxed in the tub while I waited for the oil to melt.
 
I was impressed by the lovely scent that filled the bathroom when I lit it and as soon as the oil had melted I blew out the flame and scooped some of the buttery product on to my skin. The rich smooth texture felt amazing on my dry elbows and I couldn’t resist lathering the rest of my body as well. The oil absorbed into my skin very easily and the smell… I can’t get enough of it! My skin carried the beautiful fragrance until I went to bed a few hours later and I’m convinced it must have been part of the reason I slept so well that night.
 
I woke up with super soft skin the next morning and when I went into the bathroom I could still smell the Iced Pear fragrance from the night before! After my wild scooping, my candle was left looking worse for wear, so I gently heated the surface with my hairdryer and once the oil melted, I smoothed it out with my finger to make it look good as new.
 
Besides for the relaxation and moisturising benefits of this product, what I love most about it is the fact that it is made in South Africa and it’s environmentally friendly (the wicks are made of cotton and are soot-free). The oil is also filled with antioxidant properties that nourish and feed the skin. Finally, I can indulge without feeling guilty! This ultra-luxurious product has completely changed my views on bath-time relaxation, and now I can’t imagine my me-time without it. The perfect gift to spoil a loved one, and the perfect present to yourself when you need a little pick-me-up, this product is a winner in more ways than one.

But let’s take it back a week, to the former, non hand-cream-loving me. My aversion to hand lotions was a result of many empty promises…products claiming quick absorption and non-stickiness still had me waving my hands in the air in the hope that I could speed up the absorption process. I vowed that I would only give another one a chance if they came recommended by other beauty eds or had won a host of awards… which brings me to L’Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream.
 
From the first application of this super creamy balm, my hands were thanking me. Not only does it absorb beautifully (I was back tapping away on my keyboard within a minute of applying it) but it also leaves hands feeling velvety soft. As for the scent, its delightfully subtle will never compete with your fragrance for attention. And although a little goes a long way, you’ll find you develop a touch of automysophobia (fear of being dirty) just so you have an excuse to wash your hands and apply it again!

","Banish dry skin with this all-over exfoliating soap!","","","I know what you’re thinking – why are we reviewing a soap bar? This is not just any soap, but rather two months’ worth of body treatments in one nifty little bar.
 
As a fan of body treatments, I was super excited to try this out at home. While in the shower I lathered up with this polishing soap in the hope that it would helps stimulate production of new collagen as well as buff away dry skin and ingrown hairs. I paid particular attention to my knees, elbows and upper arms and even after the first treatment, I could feel a difference. After two days I was chomping at the bit to give it another go and this time I used it in the bath, again concentrating my efforts on dry and ingrown-prone areas.
 
I’ve been using the Earl Jones Microdermabrasion Soap for three weeks now and I can’t tell you the difference it’s made, particularly on pesky ingrown hairs and my minor case of keratosis pilaris (those annoying bumps often found on your upper arms). When I’m done scrubbing, I carefully store the bar – a word of caution - don’t leave it in the shower for the rest of the houselhold to use or in a wet area – it’ll disintegrate. Then hop out of the shower or bath and apply an antioxidant rich body lotion (read: anti-cellulite cream) which works and absorbs better after an exfoliation.
 
Sensitive skin? Instead of using it on your whole body, target problem areas that are prone to ingrowns and dry skin. And one last word of caution: No matter how amazing the results, resist the urge to use it on your face!

","This natural, South African body moisturiser enfuses the senses with the aromatic smell of neroli.","","","Africology and I have been friends for many years and after a long, stressful day (there seem to be more of them as we near the end of the year) I treat myself to hot bath with a dollop of Africology Neroli Body Balm. As soon as I open the jar and get a whiff of that super calming, signature scent, my shoulders immediately start to relax.
 
Not content with just bathing in it, after towelling off, I cover myself and every area prone to dryness – it works wonders on heels, knees, elbows and cuticles. However, as the month goes by I seem to have less dry areas that need attention. I also love the fact that a little goes a long way and that the balm-like formula absorbs beautifully leaving no sign of stickiness.
 
If you’re in Johannesburg or the surrounding areas, once you’ve received your December rubybox and tried your Africology Neroli Body Balm, don’t forget to book your complimentary Facial Analysis at the Rosebank store – just going to the store is a treat in itself! Give them a ring on             011 447 5877       or stop by Shop G18, The Zone, Phase 2, Rosebank. Have time for a massage? Even better! Read more about it here!
 
P.S. Africology, if ever I have the opportunity to create my own bespoke fragrance, you’ll find it’ll include a blend of African potato, rooibos, aloe ferox and marula too. Or I suppose I could just continue covering myself in Africology Body Balm

","Let out your inner animal with this gorgeous leopard print nail strip.","","","Of all the makeup looks out there, beautifully painted nails are my absolute favourite. If I had the time and the patience, my nails would be a different colour every week and I’d take nail art to the next level. However, as I’m always in a rush, I tend to smudge my nail polish almost every time. Plus having to wait for my base coat, two colour coats and a top coat to dry, means I try doing things with wet nails, only to ruin my mani.
 
I’d heard of nail strips before, but I never tried them because I didn’t believe a “sticker” would last any longer than normal nail polish, plus it seemed tricky to cut them into shape. Incoco Nail Polish Appliqué Strips proved me wrong, and since trying them out, I will never look at nail art in the same way- I was totally blown away! The strips are made from 100% real nail polish, and contain a base coat, colour coat and top coat. Free of formaldehyde and toluene, they won’t damage your nails either, so you can chop and change without worrying about harmful ingredients. They’re available in over 100 colours and styles, and for my first time, I chose a hot pink. One of the things I loved most about the product is that the strips come in a variety of different sizes, so you can match them to fit your nail shape perfectly. They’re flexible and stretch easily, so you can gently pull at them to make them fit over your whole nail. Once you’ve selected the right size, you gently peel the strip off its backing paper, place on your nail, stretch horizontally and across (if needed), fold the excess strip over the edge of your nail, and file it off. If you make a mistake you can gently peel the strip off and re-apply (provided you haven’t smoothed it out and filed the edge off). No mess, no smudges, no unpleasant smell and best of all, no waiting for liquid polish to dry. When they start to wear off or you get tired of the colour, you just lightly wipe over them with some regular nail polish remover on a piece of cotton wool. This was the fastest I’ve ever done my nails and the strips were super easy to apply too. It looked like I was wearing normal nail polish, except it had a very glossy shine to it that you don’t often find in liquid nail colours. The colour lasted a full week before it began to chip (to me this is extremely long, considering I’m always using my hands and normal polish lasts about three days). I got loads of compliments and was even asked if I’d had my nails done professionally. I’ll definitely be trying these strips again, and I think I’ll pick a colourful print next time.

Thought ruby slippers were only to be found in The Wizard of Oz? Ruby Shoes gives nails a rich glittery shine, so you can have jewel-like shimmer at your fingertips.
","Glittery and jewel-like, these ruby red strips suit any skin tone!","","","Of all the makeup looks out there, beautifully painted nails are my absolute favourite. If I had the time and the patience, my nails would be a different colour every week and I’d take nail art to the next level. However, as I’m always in a rush, I tend to smudge my nail polish almost every time. Plus having to wait for my base coat, two colour coats and a top coat to dry, means I try doing things with wet nails, only to ruin my mani.
 
I’d heard of nail strips before, but I never tried them because I didn’t believe a “sticker” would last any longer than normal nail polish, plus it seemed tricky to cut them into shape. Incoco Nail Polish Appliqué Strips proved me wrong, and since trying them out, I will never look at nail art in the same way- I was totally blown away! The strips are made from 100% real nail polish, and contain a base coat, colour coat and top coat. Free of formaldehyde and toluene, they won’t damage your nails either, so you can chop and change without worrying about harmful ingredients. They’re available in over 100 colours and styles, and for my first time, I chose a hot pink. One of the things I loved most about the product is that the strips come in a variety of different sizes, so you can match them to fit your nail shape perfectly. They’re flexible and stretch easily, so you can gently pull at them to make them fit over your whole nail. Once you’ve selected the right size, you gently peel the strip off its backing paper, place on your nail, stretch horizontally and across (if needed), fold the excess strip over the edge of your nail, and file it off. If you make a mistake you can gently peel the strip off and re-apply (provided you haven’t smoothed it out and filed the edge off). No mess, no smudges, no unpleasant smell and best of all, no waiting for liquid polish to dry. When they start to wear off or you get tired of the colour, you just lightly wipe over them with some regular nail polish remover on a piece of cotton wool. This was the fastest I’ve ever done my nails and the strips were super easy to apply too. It looked like I was wearing normal nail polish, except it had a very glossy shine to it that you don’t often find in liquid nail colours. The colour lasted a full week before it began to chip (to me this is extremely long, considering I’m always using my hands and normal polish lasts about three days). I got loads of compliments and was even asked if I’d had my nails done professionally. I’ll definitely be trying these strips again, and I think I’ll pick a colourful print next time.

As a young girl, a family friend brought me a mud mask and my experience of it was everything but pretty. It was sticky, messy and I was left with an awful smell on my face for hours!
 
Needless to say my opinion of face masks took a huge blow and I’ve avoided them ever since. This, however, changed drastically when I tried the AHAVA Purifying Mud Mask in my November box. This deep-cleansing mask is fused with detoxifying agents and minerals from the Dead Sea that thoroughly cleanse while zapping excess oil and preserving your skin’s natural moisture balance. As if that’s not enough, it’s also natural, animal-friendly and allergy tested.
 
Sounds too good to be true? I thought so too, but this product delivers on every promise it makes. I left it on for about two minutes, and straight after rinsing I felt a noticeable difference. My skin was velvety soft and felt refreshed and energised. It got rid of excess oil (which my combination skin tends to struggle with) and didn’t dry my skin out at all.
 
The mud itself was lighter than I expected and dried super fast. Best of all? No lingering smell! I hardly noticed it’s subtle scent.
 
I never thought I’d say this, but I’ve been converted- face masks all the way! Why not make this product part of your weekly beauty routine? Your skin will be forever grateful!

There’s always been a little bit of doubt in my mind as to whether a natural cleanser can remove impurities as effectively as a chemical-based cleanser does.
 
However, as I’m always up for trying new products, I jumped at the chance of testing the Africology Purifying Cleansing Gel. I’ve been in love with local brand Africology ever since I first tried their Neroil Body Balm last year, and this cleanser reinstated my admiration for the brand.
 
The first thing I noticed (and it’s impossible to ignore) was the gel’s gorgeous scent. I’m used to cleansers with soapy smells, so this was completely new to me. Containing 100% natural essential oils, it felt as if I was getting an aromatherapy treatment every time I cleansed my skin. The texture is smooth and foams beautifully, plus I found a little goes a long way as you only need two or three small pumps of liquid to work up a foam.
 
And as for my reservations about its cleansing power, I can happily admit that I’ve changed my views on natural cleansers. My skin felt silky soft and refreshed after I used it. As an extra test, I swiped a piece of cotton wool over my cheeks after cleansing (as I often do to test if my cleanser’s doing its job) and I couldn’t see any trace of impurities left behind. I can’t wait to try the rest of the range now too, as I think the cleanser will work even better when accompanied by Africology Moisturiser SPF15 and Africology Night Cream. If you aren’t familiar with this cleanser, do yourself a favour and give it a try- you won’t regret it!

Prevent them from falling victim to the sun’s violent rays by protecting them with a moisturising balm. Piz Buin In Sun Sun Lipstick SPF20 provides long-lasting protection from UVA and UVB rays, plus added aloe vera keeps lips soft and supple. Great for sun protection all-year round, and works wonders on wintery dry lips too.","Nourishing and moisturising, this lippie protects lips from harmful UV rays all year long.","","","I’m a bit of a lip balm obsessive, so much so that when I get together with other beauties we can easily pass the time discussing the benefits of lippies, glosses, balms, tints, and every other lip formulation known to man. Often passerbyers have come up to us, shared their chapped lip tales and asked for advice. Now in order for me to dish out advice I need to know a bit about their lifestyle…
 
Long story short, if anyone is looking for a hydrating lip balm with an SPF I recommend Piz Buin In Sun Sun Lipstick SPF20. This super rich lippie is packed with hydrating aloe vera and it smells delish. Plus, it’s not one of those that require a reapplication every few minutes; you can easily get 30-40 minutes (and a cup of tea in between) before you feel the need to reach for your handbag again.
 
I know what you’re thinking – why a lip balm with SPF in the June rubybox? Don’t be fooled by the grey skies – the sun’s UVA and UVB rays don’t discriminate between seasons. Even though we’re covered from head to toe in warm woolies, our lips are often left exposed to the harsh elements. This nifty lippie provides intense moisturisation, sun protection and even has a semi-plumping effect…what more can you ask for?
 
What did you think rubies? Love it as much as we do?

At least that’s what I thought until I tried my Skin Logic mask earlier this week.
 
As a long-time sufferer of oily, sensitive skin, I chose the Tea Tree Healing Face Mask for its soothing properties, but with the wide selection the brand has available, there’s a mask available for every skin type.
 
The masks I’m used to applying usually consist of thick, paste-like liquid, so I was surprised to find that the Skin Logic mask is made from silk cellulose, a soft, man-made silk, complete with holes for your eyes, nostrils and mouth. But before you question its effectiveness, I have to mention that it’s not a dry mask. It’s soaked in a thick, clear serum, so when you take it out of its package, watch out for any excess liquid.
 
I carefully placed the mask on my already cleansed and toned face, and lay back to relax for twenty minutes. My first thought was that it was rather chilly, and that it would be a wonderful treat on a hot summer’s day. After a couple of minutes my skin was used to it, and I enjoyed the pleasant soothing sensation.
 
As a bit of a busy-body, twenty minutes is a long time for me to lie back and relax, but if you’re looking for an excuse to take some time out, this is definitely it. When I removed the mask there was still quite a bit of moisture on my face, which I patted into my skin (and used the excess on my neck and collarbone area). I didn’t notice a difference straight away, but an hour or two later I could feel that my skin was a lot smoother and softer than it usually is. The real difference came the following day – I woke up with noticeably clearer skin, and for once, I didn’t have a shiny forehead by 11am.
 
Thanks to tea tree, pine needle extract and omega 3 fatty acids, the mask soothes while it repairs, and regulates excessive oil production too. It’s definitely something I’d use again, and I can’t wait to try some of their other masks too!

Then you’ll love this captivating, sensual version of the original scent. A powdery oriental, it’s chock-full of feminine iris, fresh flowers and musks and gradually warms to beautiful notes of amber and vanilla. Irresistibly French and sophisticated, it’s a must for anyone who’s after a bit of ooh la la!","A powdery oriental, this fragrance is as captivating as it is timeless.","","","Chloé Love, Chloé Eau Intense reminds me of my mom’s favourite perfume, Royal Secret by Germaine Monteil. Launched in 1958, it comes to us from a different era. It’s timeless and romantic, and it makes me think of black and white movies where you imagine the scents to be so captivating, you swear you can smell them right through the silver screen.
 
I think Chloé Love, Chloe Eau Intense smells the way a girl’s bedroom should smell. Clouds of powder in the air, the smell of hairspray, pantyhose, powder puffs, hot rollers and hand mirrors. The beauty ritual, like Chloé Love, Chloé Eau Intense, is something incredibly intimate and personal. It didn’t take long for this feminine fragrance’s powdery scent to nestle into my skin. In spite of its intensity, I found it to be very comforting. I couldn’t resist breathing more and more of it in, filling my lungs with its talc powder notes.
 
Wearing Chloé Love, Chloé Eau Intense is like applying makeup in a vanity mirror. Flower notes and vanilla for the foundation, orange blossoms and pink pepper to illuminate, and for the powder puff finish? Powdery musks, of course!
 
The bottle is dipped in a beautiful nude pink, Chloé’s signature colour. I love that a petite gold chain is used to fasten the lid- it adds that extra bit of glamour! My verdict? It makes the perfect dressing table accessory. Bring this fiercely feminine fragrance into your beauty ritual, and fall in love with Chloé Love, Chloé Eau Intense today.

These cooling eye masks soothe tired eyes and reduce the appearance of fine lines, puffiness and those dreaded dark circles. Apply to cleansed, dry skin and relax for five minutes - your eyes will feel instantly rejuvenated! Specially designed for the delicate eye area, these slices don’t contain any chemical preservatives and are filled with the best in natural and organic plant extracts.","Boost tired eyes and get rid of dark circles with these easy-to-use natural eyeslices.","","","My eyes take a bit of strain and more often than not, it shows. Not only do I spend hours in front of my computer every day, but I also wear contacts and suffer from seasonal allergies. So what am I left with? Redness, dark circles and occasional puffiness. My eye drops and concealer have become absolute must-haves, and I can never leave the house without them.
 
I’ve tested a lot of products over the past year and even though I’ve come across some amazing eye creams and gels, I haven’t really noticed a significant difference after using any of them. So after a pack of Eyeslices landed on my desk last week, I decided to take time out of my hectic schedule and treat my eyes to some much-needed pampering.
 
Looking a bit dull and tired, and my “panda-eyes” in full swing, I applied the slices over my closed eyes (and cleansed skin) and relaxed for about ten minutes. That may not sound like much, but it was enough time to wake my tired eyes and make a difference to my sometimes zombie-like stare. The slices contain natural plant ingredients and are made from a gel that has cooling and soothing effect on the skin. They take the shape of your eyes when you apply them, and initially felt quite cold, but after about a minute it became more comfortable and felt soothing rather than chilly. I gently peeled them off, and was left with an incredibly refreshed feeling. At first I couldn’t really notice a difference in my appearance, but when a friend came to visit a couple of hours later and asked why I looked so “awake”, I knew it had something to do with my eye treatment.
 
It just goes to show that sometimes all you need is a little TLC (along with a great, easy-to-use product) to liven up your peepers. Eyeslices are reusable, so I’m definitely keeping them in my handbag from now on!

With a precision tip, you get the perfect line without any drying, skipping or mess. Quick and convenient, this liner is the answer to beautiful, long-lasting makeup. Got the shakes? Draw short lines and play join-the-dots rather than attempting one long swish of liner","Cat eye or winged eye, this ultra-thin liquid liner lets you perfect the look ever time.","","","All my beauty and style icons have something in common. I’ll give you a hint, Amy Winehouse, Elizabeth Taylor and Dita von Teese master the look. I’m talking about the perfectly lined eye – cat-like and alluring, it’s a look I’ve always loved, but never managed to perfect.
 
I’ll be the first to admit I’m extremely intimidated by liquid liners. In my case, practice never made perfect, as after years of trying I still smudge it every time. Plus having an unsteady hand doesn’t make matters any easier- I usually end up trying to save my lids with an ear bud dipped in makeup remover, and always just give up and try something else. I’ve even tried those liners that look like koki pens, but to no avail- they’re always too thick and dry out too quickly.
 
That was until I came across the next generation of eyeliner technology: the Maybelline Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner from the June rubybox. You could say I was a little sceptical before I tried it, but as a beauty fanatic (and hopeful), I’m always willing to give a new product the benefit of the doubt. What I experienced with this liner, however, went beyond all my expectations! Firstly, it has a teeny-tiny felt tip (which didn’t mean much to me before I saw it), but I can honestly say that it’s the thinnest tip I’ve ever seen (it’s 0.4mm!!) So thin, in fact, that even if your hand slips, the oops is so slight, it doesn’t even interrupt your application. I could draw the line precisely, with no smudging in sight and after playing around a bit, I could even manage a subtle upward flick.
 
I wore it to work and to dinner afterwards, and by the time I got home that night it still looked fresh and clean- as if I’d just applied it a short while before. It hadn’t even faded the way most liners do, nor did it start peeling off. All I can say rubies, is that it’s actually left me dumbstruck, as I had no idea a liquid liner could be this long-lasting and fuss-free! If you haven’t tried it yet, do yourself a favour and give it a go- it’ll change your perception of felt tip liners forever. A new liquid liner devotee, I may not be the next Amy Winehouse, but now I can certainly rock black eyeliner the way she did!

This fruity oriental opens with sweet pomegranate before settling into a heady blend of black orchid and exotic fruits. Sensual, long-lasting base notes of amber, mahogany and musk stay on the skin for hours and complete this sexy scent.","Sexy and sensual, this exotic fruity floral enfuses the senses with notes of forbidden fruit.","","","I have a long-standing appreciation for Calvin Klein. Though I wasn’t very familiar with their fragrances up until this year, I’ve always loved what the brand stands for, and their gorgeous ad campaigns get me every time. After falling in love with Calvin Klein Beauty and Sheer Beauty in May, I had high expectations of Euphoria. However, once I discovered it’s a floral oriental, I became a little reserved. When it comes to fragrance, the word “oriental” scares me a bit. Don’t get me wrong – I like oriental scents, I just find that they don’t usually work well on me (and I’ve smelt way too many awful, heavy oriental perfumes in the past that probably put me off the category completely).
 
As a bit of a fragrance fanatic though, I gave Calvin Klein Euphoria a try and must admit it was a wonderful surprise. I expected it to be a heavy scent, but instead I found it sensual and inviting without being overt. So what does it smell like? When I first spritzed it on, I was intrigued by the burst of exotic fruits and pomegranate, but I actually preferred the scent an hour or two later, when beautiful notes of black orchid and dewy lotus blossom began to develop. By the afternoon I was left with a lingering warm scent of liquid amber and mahogany wood (which I must say, is great for the icy Cape Town weather). Even though it’s completely different to any of the fragrances I own, I enjoyed wearing it, and would definitely spritz it on again.
 
Plus, the packaging is really attractive too- I love the amethyst-coloured bottle (a bit of prettiness never hurt anyone), and the design is really sleek and sophisticated. So there you have it rubies, I take back my words- seems there are oriental scents out there that work for me. Check back next week when we review Calvin Klein Forbidden Euphoria!

Forbidden fruit sound good to you? It opens with a burst of peach blossom, sparkling mandarin and iced raspberry. With tiger orchid and jasmine at the heart and a selection of musks and cashmere woods at this base, this cheeky scent contains something for everyone.","The love child of Euphoria, this fruity floriental awakens the senses with notes of mandarin and cashmere.","","","Not big on soap operas? Me neither, but if the Brookes and Ridges of day-time television taught me anything, it’s that we always want what we can’t have. So if a genie were to bottle an affair to remember, what would it smell like? Calvin Klein has the answer! Calvin Klein Forbidden Euphoria is the love child of Euphoria – its younger (and racier) other half.
 
My first memory of Calvin Klein is of me tiptoeing into my big sister’s bedroom to squirt myself with her CK One and trying not to get caught. So I couldn’t wait to let Forbidden Euphoria have its wicked way with me. Because it’s a fruity floriental, the smell of bushels of apples and freshly-cut daisies came to my mind. But I found no cookie-cutter ingredients in this love potion. Drawn in by passion fruit and mandarin, I fell in love at first spritz. I think a perfume, like a romance novel, should unfold over time, and before long, aromas from the Far East were unlocked, and tiger orchid and jasmine charmed my senses. Later, notes of warm cashmere woods and patchouli settled on my skin. I liked wearing this fragrance because it hit all the right notes. It’s passionate without being too pushy, and complex in a fuss-free kind of way. I was also impressed that it lingered on my skin well into the afternoon.
 
When I think of Calvin Klein, I can’t help but see in black and white.  So I love that we get to see this ad campaign with rosy-coloured glasses on. I also love the shape of the bottle. It reminds me of a genie’s lamp – I just want to rub it!
 
If there’s a message in this bottle, it’s that Eve gave in to the forbidden fruit, and so should you! What do you think, rubies, were you charmed by this fragrance?

Dating as far back as Ancient Egypt, we have Cleopatra to thank for that purrrfect cat-eye. Also, if boys were cast as girls in Shakespeare’s first plays, how did the English playwright turn an average Joe into a Juliette? With kohl liner, of course!  Today, eyeliner (and guyliner) takes centre-stage onscreen. Natalie Portman’s transformation from a white to a black swan has the work of an eye pencil written all over it.
 
I consider kohl liners a cosmetic classic, so I couldn’t wait to audition Maybelline Master Drama Crayon Khôl. If my makeup bag is a bag of tricks, this eyeliner is the master of illusion. It’s magic because you can use it to define, and also to change the shape of your eye. Plus, I love that it’s a pencil shape with a creamy texture. If you like yours sharp and thin like an HB, or blunt and chubby like a MonAmi, a pencil lets you decide.
 
I believe a good quality liner should do the work for you- I like to feel as though I’m painting a picture, not constructing Stonehenge. One sweep across the lid from this liner is all it takes for me to achieve a streak that is dense enough without being caked. It’s soft and easy to apply, but sets well, so you won’t be left looking like a washed-up rock star.
 
To create the illusion of longer eyes, use this wand to make a flick up towards the end of your eyebrow.

It’s hard to believe such a lightweight formulation can pack such a powerful hydrating punch, but it does!

This key ingredient is the single most powerful antioxidant, plus the advanced delivery system helps combat environmental stress and helps correct visible signs of ageing such as fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots and discolouration. If you’re using it as a day and night cream, it’s best to apply sunscreen after moisturising in the morning, as there’s no built-in SPF. I’ve been applying my BB cream (which has an SPF40 included) straight after moisturising as I love a multi-tasking product! Or you can apply a sunscreen like Prevage Triple Defense Shield SPF 50 Sunscreen (more on that next week).
 
Plus, if you’re a sucker for packaging, you’ll love the unique twist-up locking pump that makes it perfect for travel! Prevage Hydrating Fluid is available at selected department stores around the country for R850 (50ml).

I’m a big fan of hair treatments, but often I don’t have the time to wait twenty minutes before rinsing them out. This morning however, I could treat my locks to a much-needed moisture boost in the shower as Aussie only requires a few extra minutes (plus I could squeeze in a full body scrub while waiting for the mask to penetrate).
 
After shampooing I opened the sachet and the first thing I noticed was the amazing grape-like scent that took me straight back to my childhood. Packed with aloe vera and jojoba seed oil, I applied the nourishing treatment and concentrated on my ends which need some extra TLC. Depending on the level of your frizz, you can leave the treatment on for up to three minutes. I left mine on for two minutes and while the steam of the hot shower was helping turn my frizz-prone locks into Giselle Bundchen-style waves I got to work on a much-needed full body scrub.
 
After two minutes, I rinsed out the treatment and hopped out the shower. Already my hair was noticeably easier to comb, which makes a welcome change and after blow drying, my hair felt super soft and silky, with just the right amount of bounce and no flyaways or frizz in sight! It’s not called a Miracle Mask for nothing and the generous 20ml sachet means I can get another two treatments out of it!

Using a hairdryer? Spritz on towel-dried hair from about an arm’s length away. Prefer to flat iron? Spray section by section onto dry hair before ironing.","Never let your hair suffer from breakage and heat damage again with this fragrant heat protector.","","","I’m not usually a flat iron type of girl. Don’t get me wrong- I love poker straight hair, and wish I could wear mine like that more often, but due to time constraints and fear of heat damage, I rarely go through the effort. Recently, however, I’ve ditched my concerns as I’m embarking on a new project- being a hair model in a competition for my hair stylist.
 
As we’ve been practising styles a couple of nights a week my hair’s been blow-dried, flat ironed and curled to exhaustion. I’ve never exposed it to as much heat as it’s gone through recently, and although I haven’t noticed any damage yet, my prevention-rather-than-cure attitude called for action.
 
I loved the Lee Stafford Dry Shampoo from the April rubybox, so I was eager to try the Poker Straight Flat Iron Protection Shine Mist in May, and what better way than testing it out during a few of my trips to the salon. My stylist sprayed the product on to my towel-dried hair before blow-drying, and again on each section of dry hair before flat ironing.
 
Not only did my hair feel soft and healthy after each session, but I could also notice a lovely shine that’s never been there before. My usually static-prone locks behaved beautifully with no frizz in sight. Plus it has a lovely smell, so no cringing like I usually do when spraying chemical-scented products! I carry mine around with me in my handbag now, and won’t let anyone come near me with a hair appliance before a few sprays. Have any of you had a chance to try it, rubies? What did it do for your hair?

Feminine and elegant, the fragrance is represented by the gorgeous Diane Kruger. If you’re looking for an alluring scent that’s simultaneously sophisticated, this is the one for you.","A bouquet of white flowers, Calvin Klein Beauty lives up to its name.","","","A name says a lot about a fragrance. Though they’re sometimes a bit vague, or seem like they have no connection to the actual scent, names plays a large part in our perceptions of perfumes. How often have you asked someone what perfume they were wearing, only to be totally surprised by their answer, because you’d never have imagined “that” scent to smell so lovely…
 
When I first heard the name Calvin Klein Beauty I had a very clear idea of what I expected the fragrance to be like. Having read it was a floral (my fave), I envisioned a scent that’s captivating, feminine and elegant. And after seeing Diane Kruger grace the advert in a white dress, I was pretty certain the scent was given its name for a good reason.
 
After testing it for a couple of days, I can honestly say that the only word I would use to describe it, is “beautiful.” I have never come across a fragrance that lives up to its name the way this one does. Not only is it soft, feminine and elegant, but it has a modern edge while still being timeless. I couldn’t find fault with it, from the smell to the beautiful packaging to the ad campaign, I thought everything was created with beauty and sophistication in mind.
 
When I first sprayed it, I couldn’t quite identify the ingredients, but I later learnt that the top notes consist of ambrette seeds, which explains the initial sweet, floral scent. After a while the hearty jasmine notes kick in, and eventually you’re left with sensual cedarwood. 
 
I often come across fragrances I like, but seldom ones that I love. After trying Calvin Klein Beauty, I can finally add another name to my list of favourites!
 
What do you think rubies, did you like the fragrance as much as we did?

Infused with fruity notes such as red berries and peach Bellini, this luminous fragrance is represented by the lovely Dutch model Daphne Groeneveld. Sensual and delicate, it’s a beautiful scent for both day and night.","A fruity version of the original Calvin Klein Beauty, this fragrance is as young at heart as you are.","","","Every month I test a few new fragrances, hoping to add some names to my favourites list. As a big fan of Calvin Klein Beauty, I was very eager to try Calvin Klein Sheer Beauty, an update on the classic favourite and best-seller. This fruity-floral scent has proven to be just as popular as the original Beauty, and with the lovely Daphne Groeneveld in the ad campaign, I had a feeling it would be equally exciting. Though both scents have their own distinct characteristics, they are still quite similar in many ways, and are, according to me, the perfect duo.
 
So how does Sheer Beauty compare to Beauty? As one of my favourite scents, Beauty is a soft floral fragrance, rich in notes of jasmine, ambrette seeds and cedarwood. Sheer Beauty, as the name suggests, has a lighter, and even softer juice. With opening notes of bergamot and peach bellini, pink lily and jasmine at the heart and musk and vanilla blossom at the base, the scent is super delicate and feminine. Where Beauty gave me a sense of timelessness, I find Sheer Beauty younger and fresher.
 
I spritzed a little bit in the morning, and I was instantly struck by its warmth. Even after a couple of hours, it still had a strong presence that remained on my skin for most of the day. I didn’t get a sense of elegance from this scent like I did from Beauty, but I think it’s very sensual and captivating instead.
 
So which of the two scents would I pick? It’s difficult to say, but if I had to choose just one it would probably be Calvin Klein Beauty. Though I loved Sheer Beauty, I’m always won over by a classic floral, and I think that works best with my personality. Do you know the fragrance, rubies? Is it something you would wear?

Wherever I can, I buy products that contain natural ingredients, made locally and free of unnecessary chemicals. Having said that though, I expect a lot from my beauty purchases, and while I prefer natural to man-made ingredients, I never compromise on quality and performance.
 
I wasn’t familiar with Beaucience before I received my April rubybox and must admit that I was very pleasantly surprised when I read up about the brand. Not only are they certified by the Soil Association (an international organisation that developed the world’s first organic certification system) but they also source their ingredients locally, and all their products are free of controversial parabens and artificial colourants. Plus, all their packaging (be it plastic or glass) is biodegradable  and recyclable.
 
Before I ramble on anymore (I have little self-control when it comes to ‘green’ issues), I should say that I was very impressed by the Vitamin Super Cream. At first I didn’t know it could be used as a facial moisturiser, and I used it as a body cream instead (it’s suitable to use anywhere). I concentrated on my knees and elbows as they tend to get dry, but I quickly realised that it felt amazing on my legs after shaving. I have sensitive skin and if I put a fragranced moisturiser on my legs after shaving, I usually have a little reaction. As this cream is free of artificial fragrances, I didn’t have that problem. It was soothing and easily absorbed, plus my skin felt super soft afterwards. I tested it on my face too, and I think it would be great as a day cream (personally I prefer something a bit richer at night).
 
So all-in-all I loved the product, and would definitely be interested in trying other Beaucience products. What did you think rubies, did you prefer it as a facial or body moisturiser?

For those of you who’ve missed my waxing lyrical about the benefits of this wonder product, now’s the chance!
 
My obsession with dry shampoo started a couple of years ago, having always had long, dark hair I was constantly coming up with creative ways to eek one more day out of my blowdry. Since baby powder was out of the question (still a great trick for blondes though) to mask the onset of oily roots, I used to resort to a light dusting of bronzer along my hairline. However, when a friend visited the UK in 2008, I asked her to bring me back a bottle of dry shampoo and that was where this love affair began.
 
Fast forward a couple of years and whenever I’m asked what product I can’t live without, it’s always a toss-up between my lash curler or dry shampoo! The reason I love UK-based hairstylist Lee Stafford’s Dry Shampoo? It’s like a salon visit in a bottle! Whether you’ve hit snooze to get an extra 15 minutes and need to hide those oily roots or if your fine hair needs a volume boost – dry shampoo is your go-to product! It revitalises, refreshes and cleans hair instantly.
 
To mask oily roots or to give fine hair some va-va volume, shake Lee Stafford Dry Shampoo and spray your roots and hairline from about 16cms away. To ensure you don’t leave any tell-tale signs, treat yourself to a bit of a scalp massage and rub away any excess powder. Style as usual and voilà – clean, refreshed hair with added volume! Plus, if you’re anything like me, you’ll love the gorgeous Thierry Mugler Angel-esque scent, which definitely helps refresh less than savoury oily roots.
 
Rubies, no one needs to know you overslept or that your blowout is actually three days old! Tell us about how Lee Stafford Dry Shampoo has helped you!

Lather up with this broadspectrum lotion to avoid burns, sun spots and premature ageing. Packed with Vitamin E and incredibly lightweight, it has a built-in SPF 30, so you can enjoy some time outside without worrying about damaging your skin.","Make sure your skin stays protected all year long with this broad-spectrum sunscreen.","","","Already a big fan of sunscreen, I confirmed my love of Piz Buin (thanks to my April rubybox!) after I spent this long weekend away with friends and family.
 
Even though it was overcast, I was happily smothering myself in Piz Buin In Sun Lotion SPF30 and insisting that everyone around me do the same. Most complied, however for those who felt they didn’t need it, that evening they paid for it, as even though the sun wasn’t shining, over 90% of the sun’s rays can penetrate through clouds.
 
Packed with Helioplex technology, Piz Buin sunscreen protects against both the sun’s ageing UVA rays and burning UVB rays, plus the added vitamin E helps neutralise free radicals which can lead to premature ageing! Also, when it comes to sunscreen, more is not less. To protect your whole body, you’ll need about a shot glass size of sunscreen. Anything less can reduce your level of protection, so instead of applying SPF30, if you skimp, it’ll work out to around an SPF15 coverage.
 
Plus, watch out for easy-to-miss areas like your ears, lips, feet and anywhere that’s not usually exposed. And if like us, you were spending time in and out of the water, make sure you reapply frequently, no matter how water resistant a sunscreen claims to be, it loses effectiveness after being in the water, or getting sweaty playing beach bats, as well as when you towel off.
 
Needless to say, for the next few days, I had a queue of people waiting to be lubed up before we hit the boat for a morning of wakeboarding and skiing. Being the sole sunscreen provider, my bottle is almost finished, but I see that as a good things as most people don’t realise a sunscreen only has a 12 month shelf-life. So for all of you who’ve been using the same sunscreen for the last three seasons, it’s time to toss it and invest in another bottle. Old sunscreen is about as effective as body lotion (without the pretty scent).

Enjoy the fresh combination of floral, fruity and woody scents- the perfect autumn treat!","The perfect fusion of florals, woods and fruits, this scent works for every season.","","","Do you switch fragrances when the weather changes? For years I’ve kept my fragrance collection separate; spring/summer scents in my top drawer and autumn/winter scents in my bottom drawer. You probably think that’s a bit extreme, right? To me it makes perfect sense. I wear my fragrances according to my mood, and in summer I like fresh, light smells that “cool” me down, whilst in winter I prefer heavier scents with “warmer” tones.
 
So as we’re heading towards winter in full force (but we’re not quite there yet), I’ve been looking for an in-between scent that can adapt when the Cape Town weather moves from summer, to winter, to spring, all in one day. After lots of searching and spritzing, I’ve chosen Versace Yellow Diamond (from my April rubybox) as my in-between-season scent. It’s one of the few scents I’ve come across that fuses floral, fruity and woody ingredients, making it appropriate for any weather! It’s incredible how versatile it is- the orange blossom and neroli are light and feminine (and make for a great start to the day), while the musk and bergamot that kick in later are warmer and super long-lasting. There’s something very luxurious and “rich” about this fragrance too, which totally fits the Yellow Diamond name (and the gorgeous packaging too).
 
With the variety of ingredients, I can’t decide whether it’s a so-called summer or winter scent, which I think makes it perfect for autumn and means it’s sitting on my dresser until I decide which drawer it belongs in. I like it so much though that I’m pretty sure I’ll break my own rules and spritz a bit on in winter too.

We asked her to do a review on her favourite January rubybox product and this is what she has to say…
 
Dr Perricone’s products always excite me – ticking all the necessary boxes from innovation to quality. It was no different when I saw his Perricone MD No Foundation Foundation in my January rubybox.
 
I am not one to wear heavy foundation – I think it looks pretty terrible and rather than concealing blemishes, it enhances any fine lines and dehydration. Thus, I tend to opt for tinted moisturisers – this way your skin is merely made to look like a better version of the real thing. The colour is more even, hydrations levels addressed and your skin has that three-week-break-in-the-Maldives look (that we all so long for).
 
Perricone MD’s No Foundation Foundation worked really well for me and was my perfect summer product – taking me from the beach to a relaxed evening dinner whilst keeping my skin dewy and fresh (and protected with the built in SPF 30). The formula is very light so it may need to be accompanied with a light concealer if you are looking to hide those dark circles or the odd blemish.
 
As mentioned, I think one of my main ‘pluses’ in my eyes was the built in SPF – so many ladies slack off on this one (myself included) as many sun creams leave our skins feeling greasy and blocked up, however this makes protecting your skin as easy as it gets. A factor that initially worried me was the one tone for all skin types – however this matched mine perfectly and blended in well.
 
Another point to take into consideration when splashing out on this one is that a little goes a very long way, so it really is well worth the splurge!

Then you’ve probably tried dozens of skin care products but never settled on one. Every time I finish a moisturiser or cleanser I head down to my nearest cosmetic counter and buy a new one (and by “new” I mean one I’ve never tried before). Not because there was anything wrong with the one I’d used before, but just because I haven’t yet found a product that amazes me enough to stop trying out others. After all, variety is the spice of life, right?
 
So in my quest to discover my latest day and night cream, I’ve been trying Prevage which was featured in the April rubybox. Being a bit of a sun protection freak, I immediately slapped on Prevage Day Intensive Anti-Aging Moisture Cream SPF 30, which is packed with the super antioxidant Idebenone (now with an added fatty acid so it’s less reactive than the products in the original Prevage range but just as effective). Free-radical-fighting Idebenone protects skin against ageing environmental aggressors such as the sun, wind and pollution. And as I like to match my day and night creams, I’m using Prevage Night Anti-Aging Restorative Cream before bed. Designed to help skin enhance its own night-time repair process, this moisturiser combats dryness, firms and helps fight the effects of day-time environmental damage.

Firstly, I was very impressed by the texture of both these creams. They felt light when I applied them, but still provided loads of moisture. And, this may sound a bit silly, but I loved that they’re an orangey colour rather than the standard off-white – that’s thanks to the Idebenone. I like my night cream to be thick and heavier than my day cream, and although this one seemed light, my skin felt amazingly soft every morning (so it must have worked wonders during in my sleep!). I love the SPF 30 in the day cream. I usually opt for an SPF 15, but in South Africa that’s actually not high enough- especially if you’re fair-skinned like me. I felt a lot more comfortable during my long drive to work and lunch-time walk, knowing my skin was protected.
 
A splurge? Yes, at R985 for the day cream and R1085 for the night cream, but they’re well worth it.  I like to think of it as an investment in my skin’s health. It’s probably too soon to decide if I’ll stick to these creams and stop trying out new ones, but so far I’ve been very impressed. If if by the time the pots are empty I still feel the same, I might just change my ways!

Sophisticated yet modern, it’s great for both day and night time.","Clean and fresh, this beautifuly scented floral stays true to Prada's timelessness and uncompromised style.","","","Beauty and fashion go hand-in-hand, so it’s not surprising that some of the world’s most established fashion houses branch into fragrances and cosmetics. Prada may have started off selling handbags, but today their fragrances are just as famous as the looks they send down the runway.
 
But where fashion constantly changes to create the trends, fragrances aim to last, and every now and again a timeless scent comes around that’s original enough to get our attention, but classic enough to stand the test of time. Prada Infusion D’Iris is one of those fragrances. Clean and fresh, yet irresistibly soft and feminine, this scent embodies the luxury that is synonymous with the brand. Made from only the highest quality ingredients such as the Iris Pallida from Florence and Sicilian mandarin, this perfume also contains sweet orange blossom, benzoin and vetiver, adding a sensual element to the otherwise innocent scent.
 
This is what I would describe as a “soft” fragrance. It is subtle and feminine, and the perfect scent for day time. But don’t be fooled- it’s incredibly long-lasting (without being overpowering) I could still smell the iris scent on my wrists even after a long day.
 
Though I’m more of a Prada Candy kind of girl, I think Prada Infusion D’Iris will be a favourite for more people, it’s a classic that’s not going to date. Both my mom and my best friend said it was one of their favourite fragrances yet. What do you think, rubies? Do you like classic scents, or do you prefer something more modern?

Made from a delectable combination of caramel, vanilla and musk, this long-lasting eau de parfum is distinctly playful and has a fun edge to it.","Playful and cheeky, this fun fragrance brings to life a younger Prada fan.","","","Believe it or not, up until now I have never tried a Prada fragrance. Being a bit of a fashion-lover, I know the brand of course, but I’ve always associated it with gorgeous handbags and dresses rather than perfumes. When I received my Prada Candy Eau de Parfum sample in my March rubybox, I was super excited to try it out, because for years I’ve been a big fan of everything the brand’s done.
 
Though I was excited because it’s Prada, I must admit that I didn’t have high hopes that the fragrance would work for me. I usually like classic, floral, so-called “old fashioned” fragrances, and when I saw the playful packaging and read that it’s a sweet, modern scent with “real pop” (as described by a reviewer online) I was a bit sceptical. Never one to shy away from trying a new product though, I put it to the test and I must admit that my initial thoughts were wrong.
 
I would probably describe it as a semi-sweet scent. It does, after all, consist of delectable caramel top notes and soft vanilla and musk base notes. I expected it to be sickly sweet (it’s called Candy, after all), but to my pleasant surprise it wasn’t. When I first sprayed it on, it had a distinctly fruity smell that turned into a softer, almost powdery combination of vanilla and woody musk after a couple of hours. It’s certainly not overwhelming, but I wouldn’t describe it as a light or sheer scent either. By the time I left the office I could still smell it on my wrists, and it was only once I showered a few hours later that the scent disappeared completely.
 
My overall impression? Even though it has a modern edge to it, I found the vanilla soft and classic, and could definitely see myself buying the full size. I would probably wear it in autumn or early winter though, as I think it’s a bit too rich for hot summer days.
 
For those of you who received Prada Candy, what did you think? A sweet treat for autumn?

The light, non-greasy formula is packed with natural extracts and is free from nasties like parabens, mineral oil and colouring agents. After cleansing every morning, massage in gently for a radiant complexion that’s protected from daily age-inducing aggressors.","Free from parabens and other nasties, this organic moisturiser hydrates the natural way.","","","I hate to admit it, but when out shopping, I’m the kind of person who’s easily persuaded by buzz words. My latest downfall? You might have guessed it- so-called ‘green’ words. When I read the words ‘organic,’ ‘natural,’ or ‘environmentally friendly’ printed on a bottle of something my inner conservationist comes out and I can’t help but buy the product for the wrong reasons. Not wrong because it’s a bad product, but wrong because it’s not necessarily what I need, or what suits me best. The result? A bathroom cupboard full of products that I don’t use, because they didn’t live up to my expectations.
 
When I first came across the Cilaos Protective Energising Day Cream I was weary because I thought I’d seen hundreds of this type of product before. Little did I know that not only does this moisturiser protect and energise the skin, but it’s free of artificial colourants, flavourants and parabens too. Made up of a selection of 14 different plant extracts, natural ingredients such as green coffee and beeswax and infused with Vitamin E, it’s green enough for even the strictest environmentalists.
 
Most importantly though was how it reacted to my skin. I was impressed with the light, non-greasy formula and it absorbed into my skin quickly and easily. My skin felt nourished and moisturised all day long, and after using it for a few days I could feel an improvement in my skin’s texture. It also has incredibly effective anti-ageing properties, and protects the skin from daily damage and pollution. Made from only the purest ingredients in France, this daily moisturiser has won my vote. My only criticism is that I think all daily moisturisers should have an SPF factor, and sadly this one doesn’t. Other than that, I was highly impressed with the results and would definitely try other products from this brand.

Gently sweep across your face with some cotton wool- no rinsing or scrubbing required!","The perfect everwhere cleanser and toner to carry in your gym or handbag!","","","Being a woman in the 21st century is all about multi-tasking and getting things done as quickly as possible. With full-time jobs, studies, family and a social life to uphold, finding products that make our beauty routines fuss-free is more important than ever. I follow my three-step skin care routine religiously, but cleansing, toning and moisturising can be a nightmare at the gym or when travelling. When I saw Gatineau’s Micellar Water (a waterless, two-in-one cleanser and toner) for the first time I was excited to try it out, because it seemed like the perfect portable product.
 
It can be applied with a piece of cotton wool, and there’s no need to wash it off, so for skin that needs a pick-me-up or a quick cleanse, this is super convenient. Though this product is quicker and easier to use than my normal skin care products, I decided not to give up on my daily routine just yet. However, it’s perfect for my gym bag because when I’m running late for a class (as is often the case) instead of doing a whole cleansing routine (with bulky products in tow) I can quickly wipe off any excess makeup – that way I’m not late for my Kata Box session and I’m not gyming in a full face of makeup. (Although wearing makeup while working out may look good for the first 10 minutes, it’s really not a good idea if you have combination to oily skin that’s prone to the odd blemish).
 
I applied it again as soon as I’d finished my workout, and found it incredibly refreshing. My skin felt cool and fresh, and there was no uncomfortable tingly feeling (as I’ve often experienced with harsh toners before). Plus it’s suitable for any age and skin type, so my mom gave it a try too! Although I made sure she put it straight back into my gym bag once she was done.
 
What do you think, rubies? When are you using your Gatineau Gentle Micellar Water?

It contains a plant-based SPF 15, and moisturises all skin types, including sensitive or allergy-prone skins. Apply after cleansing, morning or evening, as necessary.","Utilise the power of beeswax with this natural moisturiser.","","","As someone bestowed with an oily T-zone and dry cheeks, I’m usually a little wary about super-hydrating moisturisers and balms. Well, all that’s about to change thanks to Bee Natural’s Rich Rehydrating Face Balm. Whether it’s thanks to the cooler nights or the fact that a little goes a loooong way, my combination skin has taken to this rich balm!
 
During the day, I’m all about protection and as such I’m a big fan of tinted moisturisers or day creams with a built-in SPF 30 or higher. However at night, when my skin goes to work, I prefer something that’s going to aid the regeneration process so I can wake up with a more radiant complexion each morning. For last few weeks instead of my usual night cream, I’ve been using this vitamin-rich beeswax balm instead. After cleansing at night, I rub my middle and ring finger in the tub and smooth across my face, concentrating more on my cheeks than on my T-zone. It melts into my skin and absorbs quickly, leaving me with plumper, more glowy skin.
 
If you have more of an oily skin type, save this for winter – it’s going to be the perfect accessory to combat and soothe dry flaky skin, particularly when flu season kicks in when you end up rubbing your nose raw from all the tissue blowing. (This I know, from having suffered through a summer cold!)

Apply to damp hair for added shine, or to dry hair to control frizz and complete your look.","No more frizz, dry ends or flyaways with this nourishing hair oil.","","","My long hair’s been known to suffer a bit of damage. Five years of colouring and many more years of regular blowdrying has taken its toll, and although I try to keep my strands healthy by conditioning after every wash, lately I’ve felt the need to do a bit more. My ends have been a little dry and I’ve noticed that my hair is dull and limp, even after a wash and blowdry. After much research and discussion with friends, I came to the conclusion that a hair oil might be the answer. Having never used one before, I tried Kérastase Elixir Ultime, because it seemed like the ultimate multi-tasker.
 
Not only does it promise to strengthen and repair damaged locks, but it’s also known to control frizz, help eliminate tangles and to add a lustrous shine. Sound too good to be true? I can gladly say it isn’t. After testing the product for two weeks, I’ve noticed a definite improvement in my hair’s condition. My locks feel so much softer than usual, and more manageable too. I used to struggle with knots and tangles after I washed my hair, but since I’ve been using Elixir Ultime, my comb glides through easily. I feel less guilty now when I blowdry my hair, as the combination of precious oils in this product actually strengthen and protect my hair from further damage.
 
Though it works well on dry hair to control frizz, I’ve been applying it to my wet hair straight after washing and gently towel-drying. One pump is enough for fine hair, but because mine is quite long, I used two to ensure total coverage. I was a little nervous that an ‘oil’ would make my hair lank and greasy, but the lightweight, non-greasy formulation didn’t weigh my hair down at all, and instead of oiliness I was left with shiny, healthy-looking hair.
 
After having such a great first-time experience with a hair oil, I’m completely sold, and will definitely be making it a permanent part of my hair routine!

There’s something suspiciously tempting about their stores, and I find it physically impossible to walk out of there empty-handed. For years I’ve turned to them for my body moisturisers, shower gels, makeup, and more recently, skin care products. What started out as a fascination with the variety of body butter flavours on offer, turned out to be an on-going love affair with the brand.
 
So what happens when I hear they’re releasing a new range of products? Yup, you guessed it- I trot along to the nearest store, and like a child in a toy shop, I stand around gazing at the new products, trying to decide which one (or two) will come home with me. So I was pretty excited when I learnt about Chocomania; The Body Shop’s new line of cocoa-infused body products. While I’m not the biggest chocolate fan, a collection of cocoa-filled body creams and scrubs sounded particularly mouth-watering and I thought I’d give the Chocomania Body Butter a try.
 
The first thing I noticed about this product is how rich the chocolatey scent is. As soon as I opened the tub my whole bedroom smelled like chocolate, and after applying it on my skin, the scent lingered on me for hours. It promises 48 hour hydration and it’s by far one of the richest and creamiest body butters I’ve used. My skin felt soft and velvety after using it, and it has an extremely luxurious feel to it. It also provided a nice shine without looking greasy. The butter contains 13 Community Fair Trade ingredients, continuing the brand’s promise of manufacturing products that are friendly towards the environment as well as the world community.
 
Though my skin felt nourished and moisturised after using the butter, I’m not completely sold on the scent. I’m convinced that anyone who loves chocolate will adore this product, but for me (who doesn’t have a sweet tooth) the smell was a bit too strong. Any of you chocolate-lovers out there tried it yet? What are your thoughts?

Plus, I think it’s a family thing as my stepmother has been overheard saying that she thinks ‘Mascara’ would make a beautiful name for a little girl! Since we’ve been blessed with relatively short, straight lashes – can you blame us for being a little obsessed?
 
As you may have guessed, mascara is one of my all-time favourite makeup products to try – I’ve even been known to wear a different one on each eye, so excited that I could try two new additions in one day! Now down to the business of Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Lash Extending Treatment Mascara.
 
What makes it a winner in my eyes? The thin, elegant brush distributes just the right amount of the pitch black, lash-enhancing formula to give you long, flirty lashes, think Betty Boop, rather than spiky or spidery lashes. As I love a little curl and volume, this is the perfect mascara for during the day and on weekends when I prefer to go bare-faced, except for two pumps on my lash curler and two coats of mascara.

Designed to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fight the formation of new ones, this serum dramatically reduced my first signs of ageing. The skin under my eyes felt firm and looked like it had been smoothed out. After using it for a couple of days my skin looked rejuvenated and radiant. I was even able to disguise my dark circles with an under-eye concealer, as they appeared lighter than usual and were easily covered up.

I was surprised at how gentle the product felt on my skin. Its smooth consistency contains tiny wax beads that get rid of dead skin cells without leaving any damage, so it can be used regularly, even on very dry skin. I love the fresh, lemony smell and it made my skin feel totally refreshed.
 
My exfoliation sessions are always followed up by a moisturizer, so as soon as I was done I gave the Citron Skin Indulging Body Soufflé a try. Initially I thought the name soufflé instead of lotion was a bit OTT (after all, I thought of the edible definition of the word, thinking special care needs to be taken for a soufflé to rise). No extra special care was needed on my skin after using this product though- The light and fluffy consistency of the indulging body soufflé is proof in the pudding that it’s something special.
 
The combination of ingredients make this soufflé an indulgent treat for the skin, from nourishing shea butter to sweet almond oil. It spread over my skin easily and absorbed quite quickly, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple with a luminous look.
 
A burst of citrus contains AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) which peels away the dead skin cells while rejuvenating the new skin, so it also serves as a gentle exfoliator. As if that’s not enough, it’s a natural anti-aging skin care product too!

The warm woody base of vanilla, spicy olibanum and cashmere woods lingers on your skin. ","Bring out your seductive side with this sexy, feminine fragrance.","","","When I think Guess, I think gorgeous men and women in blue jeans. I think old school glamour, black and white photos and Claudia Schiffer. To me the Guess brand isn’t about fashion, it’s about timeless pieces and superb quality. Ever since the brand launched in ’81, they’ve had the world’s attention, and any brand that manages that must be doing something right.
 
Having never smelt Guess Seductive Eau de Toilette  I was very excited to try it out. I’m easily persuaded by advertsing and packaging, so I was intrigued by the sexy ad campaign (featuring gorgeous model Alyssa Miller) and the cute gold hearts dangling from the logo-inspired bottle. But it comes down to this- no matter how beautiful an advert or a bottle is, if you don’t like the scent, the rest doesn’t matter.
 
I have to admit that I wasn’t immediately sold on it. Though everyone around me commented on how nice I smelt, I’m a floral kinda girl, and not used to warmer, woody fragrances like this one. I decided to try it out for a few days though, and after a week’s trial the scent had grown on me so much that I’m thinking of adding it to my list of favourites. It lasted really long too, and even in the sweltering Cape Town heat I could still smell it on my skin after a full day at the office. Though I’ll probably stick to my florals during the day, this is the type of scent I’d wear for a night out, and it’s perfect for anything from a party to a sophisticated dinner.
 
The combination of bergamot, vanilla and cashmere wood result in an alluring scent that lives up to all the expectations the name suggests. It’s completely true to the brand, and I think they captured Guess’s edge perfectly. It’s a must-try for anyone who loves fragrances!

Sexy but still classy, it captures the spirit of the modern age perfectly, and the Guess fragrances couldn’t be more true to the brand. A couple of days after my introduction to Guess Seductive I decided to give its sister fragrance, Guess Seductive I’m Yours, a try.
 
Though there’s a visual similarity between the two scents, they actually smell very different. Where Guess Seductive has a warm, woody smell, Guess Seductive I’m Yours is sweeter, and I found that the smell was a lot stronger on me. It has a more youthful smell to it, so I immediately associated it with a playful and cheeky attitude. With top notes of passion fruit and dewy peony, and base notes of patchouli flower and musk, the fragrance is a combination of floral and oriental scents.
 
Guess Seductive I’m Yours certainly lives up to the alluring properties the ads suggest. It’s an incredibly sexy scent and the combination of sweet floral notes and spicy oriental notes makes it very seductive indeed! I find it more playful than the Guess Seductive, and even its hot pink and black packaging has a flirtatious feel to it.
 
So how do the two fragrances compare? As a lover of florals, I should (technically) prefer the Guess Seductive I’m Yours. However, I find myself more drawn to the vanilla undertones of Guess Seductive, and would probably choose it if I had to pick a favourite. If you’re looking to get noticed though (especially with Valentine’s day approaching), you might want to give the Guess Seductive I’m Yours a spritz. It’s a stronger scent, so it makes a bigger statement, and I think it’s probably more alluring. So rubies, tell us… Which January rubybox fragrance did you prefer?

So when the 31st of December rolled around I thought it was a great excuse to get dressed up and try a new hairstyle.
 
Inspired by the sleek ponies often seen on the Gucci runways, I wanted to combine a deep side parting with a high pony – sexy and summery. Let’s just say my first attempt would’ve made regular Gucci fashion week hairstylist Luigi Murenu cringe. Luckily, my style hadn’t ‘set’ and as promised I could brush out the hairspray and start again.
 
Back to square one; separate hair into a side parting, pull into a high pony, twist a section of hair from underneath over the elastic band, pin into place, tame flayways and blast with ghd Style Final Fix Hairspray. Second time lucky it seemed and with one final check in the mirror I headed out the door.
 
I’m happy to report my ‘do stayed in the whole evening (even after a number of cartwheels – my party trick) until I brushed it out in the wee hours of 2012! And as an added extra, I really enjoyed the soft scent and the fact that my hair looked like my own and not like I was sporting a wig or helmet!

In need of something to lift my spirit during rush hour last week, I reached for it, and that was when it won my heart. A sensual mix of sambac jasmine, liquorice and gardenia petals blend into a floral, slightly spicy scent, with star anise and mandarin undertones. After spraying it all over me (I couldn’t help myself) I felt as if I was walking in slow-motion like Ashley Smith in the advert. At the same time, subconsciously singing the theme song, ‘Love to love you baby’ – I realised it put a song in my step.
 
If this perfume is supposed to ‘ignite a passion like never before’, then mission accomplished. I love to love it, baby!

As excited as I am about summer, my skin is less than so. I’ve been dealing with oily skin since my teens, and hot summer days are particularly unkind.
 
Up until now, my only solution was to carry my foundation and powder in my handbag and touch-up shiny bits during the day. Good idea? Not so much…… Layering foundation created build-up, and before I knew it, I started to resemble Cruella de Vil. Just as I considered my skin a lost cause, I tried black│Up  Matifying Base.
 
Designed to be worn either alone or under foundation, it keeps oily skin matte and shine-free all day long. I didn’t do any touch-ups, and by late afternoon, my skin still looked perfectly fresh.

The packaging, the ad campaign and the story behind the fragrance came secondary and, in the greater scheme of things, seemed irrelevant.
 
I changed my tune a couple of weeks ago when I discovered Guerlain’s legendary fragrance, Shalimar. I was drawn to it before I even smelt it! Seeing as I’m not one to be influenced by persuasive packaging, I was surprised when I found myself unable to resist the gorgeous bottle. And the scent didn’t disappoint either.
 
“Shalimar” means “Temple of Love” in Sanskrit, and was created in honour of the famous love story between Emperor Shahjahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Never heard of them? This historic leader dedicated his life to his wife, and built the Taj Mahal in honour of her when she passed away. Enough to make anyone feel warm and fuzzy inside!
 
It’s no surprise then that there’s something inexplicably romantic about this scent. Created in 1925, it’s stood the test of time and won the hearts of fragrance lovers all over the world. Now, Guerlain has launched Shalimar Parfum Initial to capture the hearts of those unfamiliar with Emperor Shahjahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal’s story. Not usually a fan of oriental fragrances, I found this one surprisingly appealing. It’s warm and exotic without being too spicy or overpowering. At first I got a strong scent of bergamot, which eventually turned into a softer, floral scent, as the middle notes comprise of iris and patchouli. After a couple of hours, the beautiful rich scent of vanilla came through, and lasted for the rest of the day.
 
This is a special occasion kind of scent for me, as I prefer something a bit lighter for everyday wear. It’s perfect for night-time though, and will bring out any girl’s inner princess!

Whenever I try a new scent, I use it over a couple of days to see how it makes me feel. Sometimes it grows on me, sometimes it doesn’t. A few of my favourite perfumes are the ones that I was uncertain about at first but that I grew to love after a couple days. Although this is how I’ve come to know my fragrance habits, every now and then I discover a new scent that blows me away from the minute I first smell it.
 
Guerlain’s Idylle Eau de Parfum is one of those rare scents. As a lover of floral fragrances, I was instantly swayed by the beautiful combination of lily of the valley, lilac, freesia and jasmine. Throw in a little bit of musk and rose, and you’ve got a floral fragrance that delights the senses without overpowering them. Floral scents are avoided by many because they are sometimes considered old-fashioned and dated. Guerlain Idylle Eau de Parfum avoids falling into this category and manages to make an older, classic combination of scents young and exciting.
 
At first the fragrance smelt fresh and crisp but after a couple of hours a richer, creamier scent with a slight fruity undertone developed. It lasted the whole day and for the first time (in a long time) I received compliments on my fragrance from almost everyone I interacted with! By early evening it still lingered on my skin and was only after a shower that it completely disappeared.
 
The overall feeling I got from the fragrance was a combination of romance and sensuality. It’s something I would wear every day, especially during summer and spring. And scent aside, the bottle and packaging is equally appealing and luxurious.
 
My final verdict? I think this scent is suited for women of all ages, as it encompasses both the classic and the modern. I’ve added it to my list of favourites, and it’s certainly a winner in my books!

Use two pumps instead.","For added shine and no more frizz, treat your hair with this nourishing hair oil.","","","Not one to shy away from experimentation, I made my way through the hair colour spectrum at an early age and once I’d been from black to red to blonde to black again I decided to try out different lengths. Luckily, I learnt my lesson early…short hair and I were never to be friends. Since then, my hair has been shoulder-length or longer which I love. However, some of my lengths are up to six years old – that means six years of blowdrying, straightening, dyeing and countless summers spent either in the sea or pool – which can’t be good and if I’m honest, lately I’ve noticed the damage.
 
So, I’ve addressed the problem by taking full advantage of the fact that hair oils are having a moment. Have you tried L’Oréal Professionnel’s Mythic Oil yet? (For all of you who ordered the October box – you’ll know what I’m talking about!) Some women, particularly those with fine hair can be sceptical about oils, but rubies not only does this gorgeous oil work as a nourishing leave-in treatment it also tames frizz and those pesky flyaways!
 
I’ve been applying it to damp hair and then blowdrying, and then depending on how well my blowdry turns out, I’ll treat my tresses to another pump. The blend of avocado and grape seed oil is working for me – just don’t tell my hairdresser, she’ll think she’s seen the back of me!
 
Tip: Fine hair? Rub one pump in your hands first before applying to damp or dry lengths.

Packed with Idebenone (an extremely potent antioxidant) and a powerful SPF, skin is not only protected from the elements, but from the signs of ageing too! Got oily or combination skin? Apply straight after cleansing. Prone to dryness? Apply after your daily moisturiser.","Protect your skin from Infrared-A rays with this non-sticky sunscreen.","","","When the words, ‘New scientific studies’… are muttered most people tend to take note. If they’re mentioned at a beauty product launch, you’re guaranteed a captive audience. Case in point; as most of you know we’re big Prevage fans at rubybox HQ (check out the Prevage Day and Night review here and the Hydrating Fluid here) but there’s a limit to how many products a range actually needs.
 
However, when we heard the launch of Prevage Triple Defense SPF50 PA+++ was the result of a new scientific study into Infrared-A rays (the sun’s rays which give you warmth) we started taking notes. Apparently in addition to protecting ourselves from the sun’s ageing UVA and burning UVB rays, we also need to be aware of the Infrared-A rays which are also a serious source of long term damage to the skin. There go those Sunday afternoon catnaps in the sun, well that was what I thought until I tried this super sunscreen.
 
Packed with a powerful combination of sun and environmental protection, this antioxidant-rich sunscreen combats all three levels of free radical assaults. Elizabeth Arden’s Vice President of Research and Development, Art Pellegrino explains, “Broad spectrum sunscreens protect against UVA and UVB rays but don’t shield skin from chronic, long term IRA damage. The Idebenone complex in Prevage Triple Defence SPF50 PA+++ provides this essential IRA protection.”
 
Now I know what you’re thinking, SPF 50 means a heavy, sticky formulation, but it’s actually the complete opposite. This lightweight sunscreen is silky and luxurious and absorbs almost immediately. I applied it straight after cleansing as I didn’t feel the need for moisturiser. And when I say applied, I mean brushed. Thanks to the unique twist brush, you sweep the sunscreen across your face without having to get your hands involved (minimsing wastage) and the cool locking mechanism makes it travel-friendly too (no leaking all over your makeup bag).  All I can say is with the miserable weather at the moment, I’m jumping at the chance to curl up in a sunny spot and feel safe knowing that I’m protected from damage – be it on a UVA, UVB or IRA level – thanks to Prevage!

Half of the time it may not be legal, I’m referring to those who manage to drive, talk and apply makeup on the way to work in the morning (I even know a beauty ed who paints her nails in the traffic!) but as we lead such busy lives time is precious to us and every minute counts.
 
When it comes to my morning routine, I’ve got it down to ten minutes when I’m really pushed. Pretty impressive I think, but what’s even more impressive is L’Oréal Paris Revitalift Total Repair 10 SPF15 which claims to address 10 signs of ageing all in one pump of moisturiser – now that’s my type of product!
 
Thanks to the May rubybox, I’ve been enjoying this multitasking fine-line-fighter for the last two weeks. Packed with Pro-Retinol, a renowned anti-wrinkle warrior and combined with Pro-firmyl technology, which helps boost the skin’s natural firming agents, plus UVA and UVB protection and I’m in love! Every morning after cleansing, I’ve been applying one pump of moisturiser to my face and neck. It absorbs easily and leaves my skin feeling comfortable with a lovely subtle glow. I also love the fact that it’s in a pump bottle as it keep those active ingredients stable (they can change if exposed to air) and I don’t have to risk getting cream under my nails as I do with an open jar – one of my beauty pet peeves.
 
Does this sound like something you’d like to add to your beauty arsenal? If you’re looking for less obvious fine lines and wrinkles, smoother, firmer, more radiant skin with refined pores and more defined facial contours then this is the day cream for you. (It also happens to be the number one anti-ageing brand in SA…all those women have to be on to something!)

Then you’ve probably tried dozens of skin care products but never settled on one. Every time I finish a moisturiser or cleanser I head down to my nearest cosmetic counter and buy a new one (and by “new” I mean one I’ve never tried before). Not because there was anything wrong with the one I’d used before, but just because I haven’t yet found a product that amazes me enough to stop trying out others. After all, variety is the spice of life, right?
 
So in my quest to discover my latest day and night cream, I’ve been trying Prevage which was featured in the April rubybox. Being a bit of a sun protection freak, I immediately slapped on Prevage Day Intensive Anti-Aging Moisture Cream SPF 30, which is packed with the super antioxidant Idebenone (now with an added fatty acid so it’s less reactive than the products in the original Prevage range but just as effective). Free-radical-fighting Idebenone protects skin against ageing environmental aggressors such as the sun, wind and pollution. And as I like to match my day and night creams, I’m using Prevage Night Anti-Aging Restorative Cream before bed. Designed to help skin enhance its own night-time repair process, this moisturiser combats dryness, firms and helps fight the effects of day-time environmental damage.

Firstly, I was very impressed by the texture of both these creams. They felt light when I applied them, but still provided loads of moisture. And, this may sound a bit silly, but I loved that they’re an orangey colour rather than the standard off-white – that’s thanks to the Idebenone. I like my night cream to be thick and heavier than my day cream, and although this one seemed light, my skin felt amazingly soft every morning (so it must have worked wonders during in my sleep!). I love the SPF 30 in the day cream. I usually opt for an SPF 15, but in South Africa that’s actually not high enough- especially if you’re fair-skinned like me. I felt a lot more comfortable during my long drive to work and lunch-time walk, knowing my skin was protected.
 
A splurge? Yes, at R985 for the day cream and R1085 for the night cream, but they’re well worth it.  I like to think of it as an investment in my skin’s health. It’s probably too soon to decide if I’ll stick to these creams and stop trying out new ones, but so far I’ve been very impressed. If if by the time the pots are empty I still feel the same, I might just change my ways!

This radiance-boosting serum is the answer to a glowing complexion. Rich in antioxidants, it moisturises and revives the skin without weighing it down or clogging up pores. Apply morning and evening before moisturising to enjoy the benefits of a faux “post-holiday” glow.","Bring dull skin to life with this illuminating serum.","","","With an upcoming birthday, I’ve been particularly interested in skincare that’ll help maintain my ‘youthful’ glow for as long as possible. Introducing Gatineau Activ Eclat Flash Radiance, a serum specially formulated to brighten tired, lacklustre skin.
 
Already a fan of Gatineau’s Radiance Enhancing Gommage from the same range (this enzymatic exfoliator is such a winner – it gently removes dead cells and brightens skin tone after just one use!) I was super keen to try this new addition to the line-up. Packed with antioxidants that’ll help fight against premature ageing as well as an exclusive Light Complex I was looking forward to a more luminous complexion.
 
After using this gorgeous, citrus scented emulsion twice a day for the past two weeks (I still have another two weeks to go before my birthday) I can happily report that I’ve been left with an exceptionally glowy complexion, so much so when people start asking why they haven’t seen me a while I think I could start claiming I’ve been on holiday, instead of the truth that I’ve been chained to my laptop! Although I applied it as a serum, as in after cleansing and before moisturising, you can also apply it after moisturising for a serious dose of flash radiance!
 
What do you think rubies? Anyone made any comments about your post-holiday glow lately?

It restores skin to a more youthful appearance by dramatically increasing the production of skin’s natural youth proteins. Sound impressive? As if that isn’t enough, it also leaves skin feeling velvety soft and super refined. Apply twice a day after cleansing, before your day or night cream and watch it go to work.","This youth-activating serum penetrates deep into the skin so you can look as young as you feel.","","","As a twenty-something who has a fairly good skin care routine going, I’ve never really paid attention to serums or other products related to ageing skin. A good cleanser, moisturiser and eye cream is all I’ve ever used, and I always believed it was all I needed.
 
I received my Lancôme Génifique Youth Activating Concentrate a couple of days after I’d been off sick, and as many people told me, I was looking rather pale and worn-out. It sounded like an interesting product because it works with the existing proteins on the surface of the skin (these are responsible for retaining our youthful looks, but decrease when we age). The ingredients in this serum make the skin’s surface more favourable for these proteins, thereby retaining them better and helping skin look younger and more nourished for longer. And it promises results in just seven days, which was exactly what I needed.
 
Not expecting it to have any immediate effect on my tired skin, I started using it twice a day after cleansing and waited for the results. I’m happy to report that after about a week I could notice a definite difference in my skin. Though I don’t really struggle with wrinkles yet, the fine lines around my eyes seemed less visible and I could see a dramatic improvement in my skin’s texture. It felt velvety soft, my pores looked smaller and I could see that my skin looked more radiant than it has in a long time.
 
So with all the different serums available out there, what makes this one different to the rest? For me, it’s the speed at which it got to work on my skin. I didn’t expect to see results after only one week, and I certainly didn’t think it would make such a difference to the overall feel of my skin. It took scientists ten years of intensive research to create this product, so it’s no surprise that it’s referred to as the “super serum.”
 
To all the lucky rubies who received this serum in their February box, what did you think of it? Did your skin feel any different after using it?

Packed with nourishing Vitamin E, it evens and tones the skin, giving you irresistibly soft, skin. Had a bit too much sun? This multi-tasker works wonders as a soothing after-sun lotion too.","This classic body lotion's been a favourite among beauty eds for decades…","","","I’m rather partial to a long soak and a good scrub, so you could say I’m a fan of body products. Palmer’s Cocoa Butter Formula has been a firm favourite of mine for years, and there are a number of reasons why…
 
Firstly, the packaging. One of my biggest pet peeves is peeling shrink-wrapped packaging off beauty products and destroying my mani in the process. The other? Digging my fingers into a tub of moisturiser and getting cream under my nails. So the fact that Palmer’s is in a bottle scores highly in my books (and there’s no shrink wrap in sight).
 
Secondly, the formulation. The light lotion absorbs quickly but it’s so effective, it transforms dry knees, heels and elbows in same way a body butter does, but without being too heavy in the hot summer weather. Plus, it’s packed with skin-smoothing Vitamin E, which works wonders on my legs, allowing me to make my way through my wardrobe of short summer dresses.
 
Lastly, the size. The miniature 50ml that we included in the February rubybox is perfect for my gym bag as it lasts a couple of weeks (mostly because even if I wanted to, I don’t get to the gym more than three times a week). Plus as it’s small and light, it’s easy to carry around – I know a couple of other beauty eds who won’t leave home without it either!
 
So rubies, do we have any other Palmer’s fans among us?

Plus it’s packed with Vitamin E which helps fight premature ageing and it smells too delish! Apply liberally before sun exposure and reapply after swimming, sweating (thanks to that killer session of beach bats) or towelling off. And remember to avoid the harsh midday sun. Not a beach goer? Apply it to the backs of your hands while commuting in to work or while driving.","Protect your skin while you catch a tan with this all-over body sunscreen.","","","My friends don’t call me Snow White for nothing. Born with dark hair and extremely pale skin, I’ve always had to be careful when it comes to sun exposure. After years of being self-conscious at the beach, I finally learnt to love my pale complexion, but unfortunately the sun didn’t.
 
I don’t tan, I turn bright pink and I have to wear an SPF lotion every day to prevent looking like a tomato. Problem? Not really, except that most sunscreens are designed for the beach and don’t work well for everyday wear. The ones I’ve tried are shiny, don’t absorb easily and, as much as I love how the smell reminds me of summer holidays, I don’t like that it competes with my favourite fragrance.
 
In search of the perfect new product for summer I came across Piz Buin’s Tan Intensifier SPF 15, and despite my sunscreen scepticism, I was pleasantly surprised. I wanted something that could be worn every day, and with Piz Buin I struck gold. Even though I applied a generous amount it absorbed into my skin really quickly and didn’t leave any sticky residue or white marks. It’s filled with antioxidant Vitamin E to boost your skin’s natural defences and prevent ageing, whilst Melitan, a peptide, enhances the body’s production of natural tanning pigments, thereby speeding up the tanning process (without putting your skin at risk).
 
What I love most about this product is that it deeply moisturises your skin while protecting it. And the lovely coconut-smell didn’t hurt either! After using it for a couple of days my skin felt soft and healthy and I could even see a very subtle glow developing! It’s the perfect sunscreen to slap on in the morning before leaving for work, but if I was spending the day at the beach, I’d opt for the SPF 30 instead.
 
Definitely a new favourite and a staple product I’m keeping in my handbag for the approaching summer holidays. Who said Snow White didn’t need a bit of help?
 
Piz Buin is available at selected cosmetic retailers throughout the country.

Perfect for protection against the harsh SA sun, this oil-free moisturiser will protect even the most delicate of skins. Apply in the morning after your daily skin care routine and enjoy the benefits all day long.","Protect your face with this high-performance SPF 50 sunscreen.","","","If anyone needs a day cream with a high SPF factor, it’s me. My extremely fair skin is easily burnt and anything longer than ten minutes in the sun (without protection) means I end up more tomato-red than peaches and cream. Add that to a fear of premature aging and sun spots, and you’ve got yourself a very pale, very cautious beauty-lover.
 
Although I always use a day cream with an SPF factor, I find it’s not enough in the warm summer months, and I need to apply a sunscreen too. Slapping a sunscreen on my arms and legs is easy, but finding one that works on my face has proven to be a bit more difficult. The problem is that most facial sunscreens are oily and leave my skin feeling clogged-up and shiny.
 
When I first tried the Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream Sun Defense for Face I was sceptical of the high SPF factor, thinking the lotion would feel too heavy on my skin. I must admit though, that I was pleasantly surprised. After using it in the sunny Cape Town weather for a couple of days, I’m totally hooked. What I loved most about the product was that it’s oil-free and didn’t leave a shiny, greasy residue on my skin. Even when I applied my foundation over it, my skin didn’t look cakey or feel clogged up at all. It absorbed easily and made my skin feel incredibly soft.
 
Anyone who’s ever used the iconic Eight Hour Skin Protectant will love this product. It has all the Eight Hour benefits, and the added SPF 50 means you can spend time outside without worrying about harmful UVA/UVB rays damaging your skin. Its hydrating formulation keeps your skin moisturised for up to eight hours, so you can leave the house in the morning knowing that your’re protected for the whole day.
 
A winning product? Most definitely. To those of you who received it in your February rubybox, what did you think about the product?

At the age of 25 (when time starts to take its toll on the delicate skin around your eyes), having never used an eye serum before, I thought I’d give Dr.Hauschka Daily Revitalizing Eye Cream a chance.
 
My first impression? The sweet scent…with delicious-sounding ingredients like rose water, pineapple extracts and marsh mallow I wanted to apply it to my lips, too.
 
On application, I could feel its cooling and calming effect, followed by an instant lifting sensation. It’s a perfect excuse for me to stay up later, and to hit the snooze button the next day. It contains avocado, macadamia nut and seabuckthorn oils which soothe and de-puff early morning eyes, and it’s absorbed in a flash. There’s no need to fan it dry before applying makeup. I love that, and the fact that I only need to use it in the morning because by the time I call it a night, removing my makeup, cleansing and moisturising are three too many things I have energy for.
 
Overall, I’m impressed! I didn’t think a rice-grain-sized amount of this product could go such a long way. More so, the skin around my eyes feels rejuvenated and my eyes brighten up my face. As far as eye cream goes, Dr.Hauschka Daily Revitalizing Eye Cream is my first love. I wish I had tried it sooner, so if you’re anything like me, get over your skepticism and get you some eye cream!

The silky combination of Neroli, Sandalwood, Petitgrain, Sage, Parsley and Juniper Berry Essential Oils leaves skin feeling super soft and radiant. Warm two drops in the palm of your hand and apply to a clean face before moisturising.","The ultimate radiance-booster, this face oil takes your skin from dull to luminous in one easy step.","","","I’m a textbook combination skin kind of girl; dry cheeks and an oily-by-noon T-zone. So when it comes to skincare, I usually look out for products that include words like non-comedogenic (as in, won’t block your pores) and those that have oil-free formulas. Needless to say, face oils were the furthest thing on my mind, that is until I discovered Decléor Aromessence Neroli.
 
Who knew a face oil could do so much? Firstly, it’s super easy to apply – just warm two drops in your hands and press into your skin after cleansing (I like to apply to my dry cheeks first). And as for the scent; the combination of fragrant neroli, sandalwood, petitgrain, sage, parsley and juniper berry essential oils make me look forward to getting ready for bed. I’m only using it as a night time treat, however normal to drier skin types could definitely get away with using it twice a day.
 
So far, I’ve noticed an improvement in my skin’s texture and radiance, plus anyone I’ve mentioned the product to who’s also tried it, yelps and squeals with delight at the discovery!
